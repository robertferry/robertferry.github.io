        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an immersive student at General Assemebly online. I currently know HTML and 
          CSS. I will know React and Python by the end of the year. I enjoy learning about how 
          computers work and operate. In my free time, I am a new Father to a 8 month year old son.
          Time with your family is the more valuable than anything. My mission is to help make the world a better place and to give
          as much as I can. If you would like to know more then follow the link below.
